## Pros

Using the observer pattern is a great way to enforce separation of concerns and the single-responsiblity principle. The observer objects arenâ€™t tightly coupled to the observable object, and can be (de)coupled at any time. The observable object is responsible for monitoring the events, while the observers simply handle the received data.

## Cons

If an observer becomes too complex, it may cause performance issues when notifying all subscribers.
