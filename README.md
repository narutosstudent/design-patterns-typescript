# Design Patterns in TypeScript

Just playing around with design patterns in TypeScript.

Referring to [Patterns Vanilla JS](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla).

## Wait, what is a design pattern?

A design pattern is a proven solution to a common problem in software design. Just like in real life, when we face a problem that others have already solved, we often use their solutions instead of reinventing the wheel. In software, these "solutions" are design patterns.

Think of design patterns like recipes in a cookbook. When you want to cook a particular dish, you donâ€™t need to experiment with ingredients and quantities each time. Instead, you follow a recipe that's already known to work. This recipe guides you on what ingredients to use, in what quantities, and in what order. Similarly, a design pattern guides you on how to structure your code to solve a particular problem.

## What can I find here?

Look in the `src` folder.

Inside it, you'll find all the different patterns.

I'm just playing around with code to get a better understanding of the patterns.
