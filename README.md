# Design Patterns in TypeScript

Built and documented design patterns in TypeScript.

My aim here isn't just the technical aspect, but understanding the problems that each pattern solves and when to use them.

## Wait, what is a design pattern?

A design pattern is a proven solution to a common problem in software design. Just like in real life, when we face a problem that others have already solved, we often use their solutions instead of reinventing the wheel. In software, these "solutions" are design patterns.

Think of design patterns like recipes in a cookbook. When you want to cook a particular dish, you donâ€™t need to experiment with ingredients and quantities each time. Instead, you follow a recipe that's already known to work. This recipe guides you on what ingredients to use, in what quantities, and in what order. Similarly, a design pattern guides you on how to structure your code to solve a particular problem.

## What can I find here?

Look in the `src` folder.

Inside it, you'll find all the different patterns.

I've tried to introduce each pattern with a "zoom out" approach. First, I'll give you some back story where we encounter the problem that the pattern solves. Then, I'll show you the code that solves it. Finally, I'll explain the pattern in detail.
